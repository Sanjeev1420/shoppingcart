Welcome to ShopEasy, a React-based e-commerce application. This project consists of the following components:

import Header from './components/Header';

function App() {
  // ... other components
  return (
    <div>
      <Header cart={/* pass your cart data here */} />
      {/* ... rest of your application */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Product Component

The `Product` component is not provided in the README, but you can include information about it here. Describe the purpose of the `Product` component, how it is used, and any specific features it may have.

### Usage
